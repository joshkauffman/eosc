var systemDelegateBWCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "delegatebw [from] [receiver] [network bw stake qty] [cpu bw stake qty]",
	Short: "Delegate CPU and Network bandwidth to yourself or another user’s account.",
	Long: `Delegate CPU and Network bandwidth to yourself or another user’s account.

Bandwidth on EOS allows you to submit transactions on the network.

Delegating bandwidth (oftentimes called "staking") and locking it up
has two effects: increasing your voting power, and
increasing the bandwidth you're allocated to use by the network.

CPU bandwidth means the time taken by Block Producers in microseconds
to process your transaction.

Network bandwidth means the number of bytes your transaction consumes
when propagating your transaction on the network, and finally putting
it into a block.

Those two types of bandwidth have burst capacity, and once used, will
both regenerate over time.

The --transfer option makes it so the receiver will be able to unstake
what was delegated to them, and receive the corresponding EOS back. It
is effectively transfering the coins to them.

Example use:

    eosc system delegatebw myaccount youraccount "1.0000 EOS" "2.0000 EOS"

Alternatively, you can use the simplified:

    eosc system delegatebw myaccount youraccount 1.0 2.0
